 ![Dynamic vs Static](http://whatismyip.network/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Static-IP-vs-Dynamic-IP-What-is-the-Difference.jpg)

* **Static website**

A static website is, as its name indicates, the result of a query by the client (i.e. the Browser) to the server. <br>
The result is expected to be the same for every clients (unless the webmaster decides to change anything on the website).
A good example of a static website is the following : [Static website](mathieubrunpicard.github.io)

:warning:

A static website, does not mean that there is no animation on the webpage. You can find video :movie_camera:, music :musical_score: or animations.

* **Dynamic website**

Conversely, a dynamic website does not display the same page for every user.
The displayed page can change based on several parameteres, for instance the data provided by the user or the hour of the connexion. Then, theses data will generate queries directly to the database of the website and these queries will generate a specific html page that will be display in the client.<br>
A good example of dynamic website is [Facebook](http://facebook.com).
